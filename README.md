# SimpleStudentInformationManager
This is the first project of a freshman . Actually , this is my final assignment of the first term in college .

The reason why I say it is simple is its function is simple . You can only set up students'information and find , change , delete , insert and sort information , but you can't store information . I have tried to implement information storage with file streams . However , I'm just a poor learner . In the days to come , I 'll learn more to improve my professional level . I will also continue to optimize the code and enrich my GitHub . 

I'm looking forward to your comments . Thank you .
